                    <p> The year 2020 shall remain etched in the memory of the Generation Z and Millennial.
                        What seemed to be a great and buzzing year became nightmarish when a deadly virus struck in China.
                        Originating in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in the people’s republic of China, 
                        the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2), also known as Corona virus, 
                        which had surfaced twice in the past (the 1920s and early 2000s) but with lower mortality and 
                        spread rate due to containment and even lower global attention would, this time prove almost uncontrollable.
                        Its rate of spread, exponential, would make it travel around the world in so short a time-frame. </p>
                    <p>Having being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), world governments adopted safety and containment measures recommended by virology experts like social distancing rules, hygiene and eventually strict lockdowns. Well, lockdowns mean no or reduced socio-economic activity. This would have a strong impact on the economy and also affect the terms of pre-pandemic contracts as all activities are brought to a standstill – I must  note though, that the climate improved for it. We shall examine the implication of the pandemic on these contracts.
                    Contractual obligations are agreements between two entities, creating an enforceable obligation to do, or to refrain from doing, a particular thing. However, these contractual obligations may be hindered by unforeseen circumstances, so in preparing these agreements, parties may leave a clause which protects their interest when some terms are not met or a game changing event happens. Such a clause is the Force Majeure.</p>
                    <p>Force majeure is a term with no specific definition, but is made meaningful or defined by members to a contract. In contractual provisions, a set or specific list of events, called Force majeure, generally events which exceed the control of parties to the contract like natural disasters, war and disease outbreaks and/or such events that are added to the clause. For this ambiguity, a term such as “act of God” is adopted by such parties in making those provisions as it is generally acceptable to be all-encompassing.
                    However, a party intending to use the contents of this clause must have reasonable and acceptable proof that the events stated are unforeseeable or unpredictable, uncontrollable and irresistible, i.e. cannot be prevented. This is to ensure that those events are not as a result of machinations of such parties to the agreement who may want to upturn the terms of the agreements based on made-up or flimsy events. Where the proofs are valid, such a party can be excused or offered consideration on the terms of the agreement.
                    Force majeure clause is applicable in a contractual agreement like rent. A reasonable example is students’ hostel rent. As a result of the pandemic and lockdown, students have had to vacate their hostels prematurely. Their contract however, still runs even though they are not using the property agreed upon in the contract. In some cases, the rent expired during the lockdown period, therefore, going by the initial agreement, such a student will have to renew his/her rent despite not having completed the session as calculated. 
                    The force majeure clause may be helpful in this case, only if the causal event is explicitly stated as force majeure in the original contract. Also, it is important to note that while Force majeure offers an option to the concerned party, it does not mean those terms of the agreement will be completely waived. What it does is allow for some considerations like extension of time-frame set on completion of contracts or deadlines.
                    As the lockdown is eased and economic activities return to normal, there are bound to be modifications to some pre-pandemic contracts where Force majeure is adopted, but only those.</p>
